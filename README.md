# Code Samples

These are a variety of coding projects I've done in the last year,
either for my own personal interest, or for classes.

Contents:
1. Fizz Buzz Neural Network 
- A simple two-layer neural network designed to play Fizzbuzz

2. A-Star Search
- An implementation of the A* search algorithm, along with several puzzles its been used to solve

3. Pacman Genetic Programming
- An attempt at applying evolutionary design principles to Pacman
- Evolves a controller for both Pacman and the Ghosts.
